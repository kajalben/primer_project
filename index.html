                    <h2>The code of evil</h2>
                    <p>After weeks of research, one gloomy November afternoon, Christian Rossow found himself in the middle of world politics completely by accident. Sitting in an office just big enough for two desks and a cabinet he was working his way through the mass of numbers blinking on his computer screen when he found something unusual.

                        The numbers came from the basement one level below, from a room without windows. Only four people besides him had a key. The room is the maximum-security lab of the university he worked for at the time. Whenever Rossow had to go down there he tried to be quick. The room was cold and noisy, there was an old air con keeping the temperature at a steady 19 degrees. This was because of the 15 high-performance computers in the lab, big as wardrobes and highly sensible to heat. Rossow used them as guinea pigs. He would infect them with the latest viruses, Trojans and worms, sent to him daily by the manufacturers of anti-virus programmes. On the screen in his office he was able to assess how much harm each virus can do. Only a handful of computers were connected to the lab in the basement, through a special programme.
